# Forms Example

This project builds a JS file that when included will find itself on the page,
and embed a form underneath it. The form is fetched from a remote server, and
built in realtime.

## Building

In order to build this project run

```sh
npm run build
```

If you want to run a small local server for testing, run

```sh
npm start
```

## Details

This project uses [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org) for building,
[Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for rendering a lite version of React, and
TypeScript for strongly typed JS.
